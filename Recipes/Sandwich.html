        <h1>Sandwich</h1>
        <p>
            Jesus fucking christ it's time to make a sandwich
        </p>
        <p>
            While you're going through this it's advisable to pray for a quick death.  It won't help but, you know, maybe make you feel better at least leading up to when that process starts.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is...NOT a short process.  Hoo boy.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Ingredients
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread Slice 1</li>
            <li>Long Pork</li>
            <li>Mustard</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Steps
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Weep</li>
            <li>Put down Bread Slice 1.  With a gun.</li>
            <li>Put some mustard on the slice.  Go completely hog wild.  Like, <em>really</em> go nuts with it.  I mean absolutely bonkers.  Excessive.  Disturbing.  Get weird, motherfucker.  You only live once and, uh, no spoilers but that process is pretty much up here.</li>
            <li>get that long pork and slap it down on the bread and mustard</li>
            <li>Mustard on top</li>
            <li><em>fuck it</em></li>
            <li>not even kidding, which out your dick and/or clam and just get right in there and do something disturbing to that sandwich</li>
            <li>by the way if I didn't mention this earlier it's open-face.  Just one bread slice.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
